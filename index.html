      <ol>
        <li class="ol-1">I am good at video games and always have been, because I started playing video games when I was the age of 4, and because of that with all my experiences
          in 2018. I went to and competed in minor leagues for <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege#promo-list-2" target="_blank">
          Rainbow Six Siege</a> and <a href="https://gearsofwar.com/games/gears-of-war-4/" target="_blank">Gears of war 4</a>, and won a total of $300 bucks with in game content too.</li>
        <li class="ol-2">Another thing I'm good at is cleaning, because of how my family is cleaning is in our families blood, and when I go to clean something.
          I like to do it as fast as possible and as efficient as possible. I have always found cleaning easy and simple to do, and I also always enjoyed the final results in doing so.
        </li>
        <li class="ol-3">Finally I am a good Listener and with that I am good at coming up with compromises. When having multiple people and or someone else and
         I in a disagreement. I find it pretty easy to have everyone agree to the same idea and meet in the middle.</li>
